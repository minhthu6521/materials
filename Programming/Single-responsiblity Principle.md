# Single-responsiblity Principle
The single-responsibility principle states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.
All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

"A class should have only one reason to change"
