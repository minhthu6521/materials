## SPECIAL CHARACTERS
- `^` | Matches the expression to its right at the start of a string. It matches every such instance before each \n in the string.
- `$` | Matches the expression to its left at the end of a string. It matches every such instance before each \n in the string
- `.` | Matches any character except line terminators like \n.
- `\` | Escapes special characters or denotes character classes.
- `A|B` | Matches expression A or B. If A is matched first, B is left untried.
- `+` | Greedily matches the expression to its left 1 or more times.
- `*` | Greedily matches the expression to its left 0 or more times.
- `?` | Greedily matches the expression to its left 0 or 1 times. But if ? is added to qualifiers (+, *, and ? itself) it will perform matches in a non-greedy manner.
- `{m}` | Matches the expression to its left m times, and not less.
- `{m,n}` | Matches the expression to its left m to n times, and not less.
- `{m,n}?` | Matches the expression to its left m times, and ignores n. See ? above.

## CHARACTER CLASSES (A.K.A. SPECIAL SEQUENCES)
- \w | Matches alphanumeric characters, which means a-z, A-Z, and 0-9. It also matches the underscore, _.
- \d | Matches digits, which means 0-9.
- \D | Matches any non-digits.
- \s | Matches whitespace characters, which include the \t, \n, \r, and space characters.
- \S | Matches non-whitespace characters.
- \b | Matches the boundary (or empty string) at the start and end of a word, that is, between \w and \W.
- \B | Matches where \b does not, that is, the boundary of \w characters.
- \A | Matches the expression to its right at the absolute start of a string whether in single or multi-line mode.
- \Z | Matches the expression to its left at the absolute end of a string whether in single or multi-line mode.
