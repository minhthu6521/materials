# Interface segregation principle
The principle states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 

Within object-oriented design, interfaces provide layers of abstraction that simplify code and create a barrier preventing coupling to dependencies.

A system may become so coupled at multiple levels that it is no longer possible to make a change in one place without necessitating many additional changes. Using an interface or an abstract class can prevent this side effect.
